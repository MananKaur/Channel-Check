# Channel-Check

In the realm of digital media, the influence of YouTube as a content platform cannot be underestimated. In the pursuit of generating data-driven insights and putting my learnings into a project, I embarked on a data analysis of three distinct YouTube channels. These channels, namely Ken Jee, Tina Huang, and Alex the Analyst, have garnered substantial attention within the data community and I will be using their data for this exploratory analysis project. 

Data Collection

The data for this analysis has been obtained using the YouTube Data API. 

Data Analysis & Visualization

1. Channel Metrics and Significance - A foundational understanding of each channelâ€™s scale - their audience reach and content library size within the YT ecosystem.
2. Metrics Interplay and Correlations - Exploring the correlations and relationships among engagement metrics - views, likes and comments. 
3. Content Consistency & Frequency - Investigating the monthly average uploads for each channel to reveal the pattern.
4. Video Publishing Trends - Revealing the strategic decisions behind the channels' preferred days and times for content distribution. This analysis highlights the synchronization between publishing schedules and audience behavior.
5. Video Upload Trends - Identifying a panoramic view of the evolution of the video uploads and a visual narrative of content consistency and strategic timing on a macroscopic scale.
6. Top Performing Videos Across Channels - Identifying and ranking the top-performing videos from each channel based on a combined evaluation of views, likes, and comments.
7. Audience Engagement Spectrum - A comparative analysis, employing box plots to characterize the spectrum of audience engagement.
8. Video Length Impact on Viewer Engagement - Exploring the relationship between video duration and engagement metrics to evaluate the implication of content duration and its effects on viewer likes and comments. 
9. Descriptive Statistics for the engagement metrics - Calculating descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for key engagement metrics such as likes, comments to draw a summary of the central tendencies and variability of these metrics, and to understand the typical performance of each channel.
